# **Capstone-3 - Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**

## **Context**
Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV, is a metric that quantifies the value of a customer to a company. From this value, a company can gauge the amount of revenue generated by a single customer and use it as an indicator for the maximum cost that can be incurred to acquire or retain a new customer. This information holds significant importance for companies in planning effective marketing strategies for valuable customers and understanding potential shifts in customer behavior in the future.

## **Problem Statement**

A vehicle insurance company aims to enhance customer retention and improve their marketing strategies. They have decided to employ data analysis and modeling to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of their customers. The presence of CLV is crucial as it provides insights into the profits earned and expenses incurred for each customer.

## **Goals**

Based on this issue, the company seeks to determine the value of a customer to optimize marketing budget allocation without exceeding the revenue obtained from customers. Furthermore, the company wishes to comprehend how factors such as vehicle class, insurance type, renewal offer types, and other features influence customer CLV.

## **Analytics Approach**

To achieve these objectives, we will conduct data analysis to identify patterns and relationships between existing features and customer CLV. Subsequently, we can develop a regression model to predict CLV based on the provided variables.

## **Evaluation Metrics**
To evaluate the model's performance, we employ three assessment metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This metric gauges the standard deviation of residuals, providing a measure of how far, on average, predictions deviate from actual values. Smaller RMSE values indicate a more accurate model.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric calculates the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values. Lower MAE values suggest a more accurate model.

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: This metric computes the average percentage error between predicted and actual values. Smaller MAPE values indicate a more precise model.
